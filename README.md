# FUTURE_CS_03 â€“ Secure File Share (Flask + Encryption)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is Task 3 of my Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship (Track Code: CS).  
I built a **Secure File Sharing web application** using Flask, with **file encryption** to ensure confidentiality.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Flask Framework)  
- Cryptography Library (AES Encryption)  
- HTML Templates for Upload/Download  
- Virtual Environment for Dependency Management  

## ðŸš€ Steps Taken
1. Created a Flask web app with routes for file upload & download.  
2. Implemented **AES encryption** for uploaded files.  
3. Stored encrypted files in `/encrypted` directory.  
4. Enabled secure decryption & download.  
5. Tested with `.txt` and `.pdf` files successfully.
